          <h1>Ariana's story</h1>
            <p class="excerpt2">
            Who am I? That’s the fundamental question of my life. I haven’t figured it out yet. I have found some good clues though. Anyway I don’t want to bother you more on this…. and I give you the right to know who the hell I am -at least on some level- and what is my mission with this blog. So here we go: My beloved husband, Ryan, and my close friends call me Aria. Since we are going to have an intimate relationship and hopefully build a soul community together, you can call me Aria too. If I want to draw a map of my life and tell you where I am at now, I got to tell you my life took a sharp right turn last year and I began fresh @ the age of 34. Now I am close to 1 year mark and progressing forward on a path which feels right, I feel like I am heading home and even though it’s an arduous journey, I am falling in love with it and delving into unknown, trusting my gut. Practically speaking, currently I am being trained as a Life Coach through Martha Beck Institute and as a Health Coach trough the Institute for Integrative Nutrition. I chose these specific training programs because I needed these stuffs to help myself get going in my life journey. I see my life as a road trip. To have a safe and enjoyable road trip, we must make sure the car is safe and sound, the engine works well and the driver is in full control of the car. I see my body as the vehicle to contain and carry my soul into the road trip of my life. My mind is the car engine which runs, controls and regulates the dynamic movement of the car. Now if the mind -the car engine- is full of junk, it may mix oil and water and break down. In this case, no matter how good looking the exterior of the car is or which made and model it is, the car is not going to move. Even if it does, it will be a miserable ride. When the car is broken, the soul -the car’s driver- can’t get anywhere no matter how divine it is and how badly she wants to get home. I needed to learn how to approach my health and maintain a healthy vibrant lifestyle so I embarked on the best in-depth holistic health coach training program I could find. Also, I seriously needed to learn how to clear my mind and how to fine-tune my perspectives and catch my limiting beliefs and replace them with new shiny good ones. Honestly I struggled with this bit for over 10 years and finally I said hands down, I am going to take part in this training because for a whole year I can be coached intensively and learn tools to work on myself. With a healthy well cared body, and a healthy clear mind, my soul can take charge and be in full control of the vehicle so I can enjoy my road trip to the fullest. My life vision is to let myself be like a hollow flute for divine to flow through and use me as a vehicle to share my original medicine with humanity with utmost love and compassion. finally my vision for the blog is to share my experiences, my truth and my aha moments. I want this platform to be a shared space between me and you to connect, share and see each other in love. As a result lift each other up and walk toward light hand in hand. Oh I almost forgot to tell you I love love love being in raw nature, traveling, eating good yummy foods, reading and of course having fun with friends and family. Yoga and walking/hiking are my favorite type of physical exercise. Loads of love Aria
